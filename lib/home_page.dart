He is killed by Tony Issac(Jagadish) and his son Russel (Abhimanyu Shammy Thilakan) who are rivals of George in the gold trade. This incident is the beginning of a ruthless gang war which keeps the story moving forward.Marco is an adopted son in George’s family and he is emotionally attached to the family. He will do anything to save the family. But George’s sister and other members dislike Marco. Still, Marco stays with the family till the end. Can he save his entire family? Well, one must not be light-hearted to know what happens in the movie.The first half of Marco sets the story in place with the help of intense plot points. Unni Mukundan’s swag and the background score helped elevate the first half. The second half of the film is filled with violence. And this is the first Malayalam film to explicitly show the gory scenes.",

He is killed by Tony Issac(Jagadish) and his son Russel (Abhimanyu Shammy Thilakan) who are rivals of George in the gold trade. This incident is the beginning of a ruthless gang war which keeps the story moving forward.Marco is an adopted son in George’s family and he is emotionally attached to the family. He will do anything to save the family. But George’s sister and other members dislike Marco. Still, Marco stays with the family till the end. Can he save his entire family? Well, one must not be light-hearted to know what happens in the movie.The first half of Marco sets the story in place with the help of intense plot points. Unni Mukundan’s swag and the background score helped elevate the first half. The second half of the film is filled with violence. And this is the first Malayalam film to explicitly show the gory scenes.",

The line which Deepika tells Akshay in the film pretty much sums up the essence of the film.Aarush, born on Friday the 13th, is considered an unlucky loser by everyone and always faces humiliation. Finally he goes to live with a friend in London. Bob and his wife Hetal are working for a casino owned by Kishore Samthani. Hetal at first is not happy with Aarush's arrival, but things improve. Bob and Hetal introduce Aarush to Samthani's daughter Devika and they get married, but she ditches him on the very first night for her boyfriend. Failing in life again, Aarush tries to commit suicide but Sandy saves him. After much confusion, Sandy and Aarush decide to get married. But more tensions arise when Hetal's father visits and mistakes Aarush for his son-in-law, and Sandy's brother Major Krishna Rao is suspicious of Aarush.Tagged with being a jinx and bringing bad luck on himself and everyone he comes in contact with, London-based Aarush, employed in the Venetian Casino, Macau, to prevent its clientèle's winning sprees, gets dumped by his girlfriend Pooja, and returns home to his pal Baburao and his wife Hetal. After a disastrous start, the couple decide to get him hitched to a homely girl, Devika, the daughter of casino owner Kishore Samtani. The marriage takes place, and shortly thereafter Devika shows her true colors by ditching Aarush for a Caucasian male, Benny. Heartbroken, he then meets Sandy they fall in love with each other.

After the couple's passing, Uday takes over in his dad's footsteps, and takes it upon himself to try and get Sanjana married - in vain, as no one wants to be associated with a crime family. Then Uday's associate, Sagar Pandey, aspiring live-action painter, who had loved Iravati, got beat-up by her brothers, and was re-named Majnu, assists in finding a young man, Rajiv, who lives with his maternal uncle, Dr. Ghunghroo and aunt, and through extortion compels Ghunghroo to accept this alliance. But Ghunghroo, at the very first opportunity, gets Rajiv to fall in love with another young woman in Sun City, South Africa. When the time comes to get Rajiv formally engaged to this woman, he finds out that Sanjana and she are the very same woman. With no escape from this predicament, the wedding is planned, invitations are sent out, and even Ranvir Dhanraj alias RDX, an Italian-based criminal don, also makes an appearance. On the day of the engagement, a woman claiming to be Rajiv's child-hood betrothed shows up, makes a successful plea to Ranvir, and gets the engagement annulled. When Dr. Ghunghroo finds out that Rajiv and Sanjana have fallen in love with each other, he decides to accept Sanjana into the family on the condition that Uday gives up on crime. Rajiv and Sanjana attempt to get Uday to take up acting in a Bollywood movie - with considerable success - so much so that Uday has no time for crime.

Failing in life again, Aarush tries to commit suicide but Sandy saves him. After much confusion, Sandy and Aarush decide to get married. But more tensions arise when Hetal's father visits and mistakes Aarush for his son-in-law, and Sandy's brother Major Krishna Rao is suspicious of Aarush.Tagged with being a jinx and bringing bad luck on himself and everyone he comes in contact with, London-based Aarush, employed in the Venetian Casino, Macau, to prevent its clientèle's winning sprees, gets dumped by his girlfriend Pooja, and returns home to his pal Baburao and his wife Hetal. After a disastrous start, the couple decide to get him hitched to a homely girl, Devika, the daughter of casino owner Kishore Samtani. The marriage takes place, and shortly thereafter Devika shows her true colors by ditching Aarush for a Caucasian male, Benny. Heartbroken, he then meets Sandy they fall in love with each other.
